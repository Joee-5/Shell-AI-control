Terminal 1: Build & Run the Path Publisher

This compiles your code and starts sending the path data.
Bash

# 1. Go to workspace root
cd ~/shellsim/Shell-AI-control/track_testing_ws

# 2. Build changes
colcon build --symlink-install

# 3. Source the environment
source install/setup.bash

# 4. Run the node
ros2 run track_visualizer path_publisher

Terminal 2: Fix the "Missing Map Frame"

This creates a dummy frame so RViz stops showing the "Frame [map] does not exist" error.
Bash

# This links 'map' to 'world' so RViz is happy
ros2 run tf2_ros static_transform_publisher 0 0 0 0 0 0 world map

Terminal 3: Open RViz
Bash

rviz2

Once RViz opens:

    Set Fixed Frame (top left) to: map (or world).

    Click Add (bottom left).

    Select Path.

    Set Topic (inside the Path item) to: /path (or /track_path).
